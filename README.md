The goal of this project was to design and implement a Library Management System using object-oriented principles and to provide UML diagrams depicting the structure and interactions within the system. A library has books, CDs, and DVDs. Each item has a unique item number, title, and a status indicating whether it is available or checked out. Books have additional attributes: author and ISBN number. CDs and DVDs have a length (in minutes).

People can borrow and return items from the library. Each person has a name, address, and a library account. The library account has a unique account number, a list of currently borrowed items, and a history of all borrowed items.
